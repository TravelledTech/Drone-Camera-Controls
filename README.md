Thanks to Code Breaker for the publically available drone dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muki2003/yolo-drone-detection-dataset/data

WorkingCameraSever: ESP32-cam code (modified default code)
MainV2.py: Primary interface code
best.pt, best2.pt: Yolo8s and Yolo8n model respectively
YOLO_ML.py: Training code

Remaining files are leftover files from previous tests.

For the record the two models made are not very good due to the limited computing power while training.
